      <p class="maintxt">
        Mental health refers to one's emotional, psychological, and social well-being; affecting how we think, feel, and act. One is not necessarily born with it– unless it’s inherited; but stress, abuse, or a traumatic event, are all factors that influence this result. Being aware of your wellness is also important. You can easily become hopeless, lacking energy, and unable to perform your daily tasks that were once easy. The stability of our mental health is important. It affects the choices we make as individuals through childhood and adulthood. These stages are necessary for life as it contributes to the way we grow and develop skills that will forever be used.
