This is an activist themed website I created through my time at partcipating at Girls Who Code, SIP Program. I wanted to 
focus my theme on mental health, as it's been on a rise, especially during quarantine, and I think awarenesses 
should be brought more on this topic. Through my website, I hope others can realize how vital the stability of our 
mental health is to our growth devlopment, and how it's important we get more access to care treatments.
